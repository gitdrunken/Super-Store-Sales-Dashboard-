Created an interactive Superstore Sales Dashboard in Power BI to analyze product sales, customer types, and purchasing patterns across various regions.

Used Power Query to clean and prepare raw sales data for reporting and analysis.

Developed DAX measures to calculate key metrics such as total sales, profit margins, sales by category, and consumer segments (e.g., Corporate, Consumer, Home Office).

Designed the dashboard with dynamic visuals including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, maps, and slicers for flexible, in-depth exploration.

Enabled business users to gain actionable insights into top-performing products, regional trends, and customer preferences, supporting more effective sales and marketing strategies.
